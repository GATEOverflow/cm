### Acknowledgments

The open-source Collective Knowledge project (CK, CM, CM4MLOps/CM4MLPerf, 
CM4Research and CMX) was created by [Grigori Fursin](https://cKnowledge.org/gfursin)
and sponsored by cTuning.org, OctoAI and HiPEAC.
Grigori donated CK to MLCommons to benefit the community
and to advance its development as a collaborative, community-driven effort.
We thank MLCommons and FlexAI for supporting this project,
as well as our dedicated [volunteers and collaborators](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
